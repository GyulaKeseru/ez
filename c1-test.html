    <h2>Reading Text: A biography of Kilian Jornet</h2>
    <p>When you picture mountain climbers scaling Mount Everest, what probably comes to mind are
        teams of climbers with Sherpa guides leading them to the summit, equipped with oxygen
        masks, supplies and tents. And in most cases you’d be right, as 97 per cent of climbers use
        oxygen to ascend to Everest’s summit at 8,850 metres above sea level. The thin air at high
        altitudes makes most people breathless at 3,500 metres, and the vast majority of climbers use
        oxygen past 7,000 metres. A typical climbing group will have 8–15 people in it, with an almost
        equal number of guides, and they’ll spend weeks to get to the top after reaching Base Camp.
        But ultra-distance and mountain runner Kilian Jornet Burgada ascended the mountain in May
        2017 alone, without an oxygen mask or fixed ropes for climbing.</p>
    <p>Oh, and he did it in 26 hours.</p>
    <p>With food poisoning.</p>
    <p>And then, five days later, he did it again, this time in only 17 hours.</p>
    <p>Born in 1987, Kilian has been training for Everest his whole life. And that really does mean his
        whole life, as he grew up 2,000 metres above sea level in the Pyrenees in the ski resort of
        Lles de Cerdanya in Catalonia, north-eastern Spain. While other children his age were learning
        to walk, Kilian was on skis. At one and a half years old he did a five-hour hike with his mother,</p>
    <p>entirely under his own steam. He left his peers even further behind when he climbed his first
        mountain and competed in his first cross-country ski race at age three. By age seven, he had
        scaled a 4,000er and, at ten, he did a 42-day crossing of the Pyrenees.</p>
    <p>He was 13 when he says he started to take it ‘seriously’ and trained with the Ski
        Mountaineering Technical Centre (CTEMC) in Catalonia, entering competitions and working
        with a coach. At 18, he took over his own ski-mountaineering and trail-running training, with a
        schedule that only allows a couple of weeks of rest a year. He does as many as 1,140 hours of
        endurance training a year, plus strength training and technical workouts as well as specific
        training in the week before a race. For his record-breaking ascent and descent of the
        Matterhorn, he prepared by climbing the mountain ten times until he knew every detail of it,
        even including where the sun would be shining at every part of the day.</p>
    <p>Sleeping only seven hours a night, Kilian Jornet seems almost superhuman. His resting
        heartbeat is extremely low at 33 beats per minute, compared with the average man’s 60 per
        minute or an athlete’s 40 per minute. He breathes more efficiently than average people too,
        taking in more oxygen per breath, and he has a much faster recovery time after exercise as
        his body quickly breaks down lactic acid – the acid in muscles that causes pain after exercise.</p>
    <p>All this is thanks to his childhood in the mountains and to genetics, but it is his mental strength
        that sets him apart. He often sets himself challenges to see how long he can endure difficult
        conditions in order to truly understand what his body and mind can cope with. For example,
        he almost gave himself kidney failure after only drinking 3.5 litres of water on a 100km run in
        temperatures of around 40°C.</p>
    <p>It would take a book to list all the races and awards he’s won and the mountains he’s climbed.
        And even here, Kilian’s achievements exceed the average person as, somehow, he finds time
        to record his career on his blog and has written three books, Run or Die, The Invisible
        Border and Summits of My Life.</p>
